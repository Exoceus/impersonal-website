            <h1>Fundamentals First</h1>
            <p>Honestly, I started this blog to force myself to learn technical concepts on a semi-regular basis. Since I’m going to read about them on my own time, why not write an article about it? I explore topics I’m curious about while trying to consolidate my learnings into a (mostly) concise and enjoyable introduction to these ideas.</p>
            <p>Also, I am very prone to slacking of on consistently writing for the blog, so if you dont see any articles published in the past few weeks, remind me please.</p>

            <h1>OppHub</h1>
            <p>When I moved to Canada I became vaguely aware of the vast number of extrcurricular activities available for students. However, I found it hard to find extracurriculars related to areas I was interested in.</p>
            <p>Hence, I found myself with a lot of spare time when COVID first hit and I tried to get out of my slump by creating what eveentually became OppHub.The website received 10,000 unique visitors in over 25 different countries with a peak of 600 unique monthly users along with more than 500 unique opportunites.</p>
            <p>OppHub will always hold a very special place in my heart as it was the first webapp I ever made and first exposed to the sheer possibilities of software development, despite innumerable times I wanted to punch my wall in the process of its development.</p>

            <h1>Wall of Projects</h1>
            <p>This is just supposed to kind of emulate a wall with post its for each project that comes. Its not supposed to be super organized, just something people can hover over/click and learn more about.</p>
