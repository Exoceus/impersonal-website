                Honestly, I started this blog to force myself to learn technical concepts on a semi-regular basis. Since
                I’m going to read about them on my own time, why not write an article about it? I explore topics I’m
                curious about while trying to consolidate my learnings into a (mostly) concise and enjoyable
                introduction to these ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, I am very prone to slacking of on consistently writing for the blog, so if you don't see any
                articles published in the past few weeks, give me a nudge.

                When I moved to Canada I became vaguely aware of the vast number of extracurricular activities available
                for students. However, I found it hard to find extracurricular activities related to areas I was
                interested in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hence, I found myself with a lot of spare time when COVID first hit and I tried to get out of my slump
                by creating what eventually became OppHub.The website received 10,000 unique visitors in over 25
                different countries with a peak of 600 unique monthly users along with more than 500 unique
                opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                OppHub will always hold a very special place in my heart as it was the first webapp I ever made and
                first exposed to the sheer possibilities of software development, despite innumerable times I wanted to
                punch my wall in the process of its development.
