                        Iâ€™m a builder at heart trying to create software people enjoy using, creating content about
                        technical topics, and tinkering with hardware.

                        The process of creating something is very fulfilling to me. I try to build things that covers at
                        least one of the following criteria: fun to build, provides value to people, cool/fresh idea, helps me learn something
                        new.

                    <p>
                        I am going to be entering my fourth year of studying Computer Science at the University of
                        Waterloo. Ever since high school, I had aimed to
                        get into UWaterloo and having been in Waterloo, I have gotten to learn so much more about
                        technology and software from a first levels approach. My favourite courses so far have been: Applied Cryptography, Object-Oriented Programming (Enriched), Compilers Lite* and Linear Programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from school, I try to push myself (not always successfully) to learn more about
                        philosophy, music and anything else that seems interesting to me.
                    </p>
