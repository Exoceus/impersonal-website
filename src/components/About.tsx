            <p>Iâ€™m a builder at heart trying to create software people enjoy using, creating content about technical topics, and tinkering with hardware.</p>
            <p>Also I like reading.</p>

            <h1>Sometimes Always Learning</h1>
            <p>Currently, I am in second year of studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and overall, it has been an amazing experience. Ever since high school, I had aimed to get into UWaterloo and having been in Waterloo, I have gotten to learn so much more about technology and software from a first levels approach.</p>
            <p>Apart from school, I try to push myself (not always successfully) to learn more about philosophy, music and anything else that seems interesting to me.</p>
