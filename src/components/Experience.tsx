            <h1>Cradle</h1>
            <p>Cradle is an early stage crypto-gaming that I joined as the 8th employee as a <span style={{ textDecoration: "line-through" }}>no stack</span> full stack engineer where it grew from 0 to over 10k users. I have worked 2 co-op terms and part time over the span of 1.5 years at the company.</p>
            <p>Some cool accomplishments were:
                <ul>
                    <li>Designing and developing security architecture using SSS to allow multi-device logins without storing private keys.</li>
                    <li>Worked as the primary developer on a Flask API that serves all company products and was used for a demo for a $4M Series A.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h1>MIT-PITT-RW</h1>
            <p>MIT Driverless is a student club collobration between MIT, Pitsburgh, Rocheter and Waterloo that competes in the Indy Autonomous Challenge (Las Vegas, Indiannapolis, Monza).</p>
            <p>Im a part of Simulation and Infrastructure team that aims to optimize the developer experience of the other subteams (Perception, Controls, etc.) by maintaining and updating the tech stack (Docker, ROS2, Asseto Corsa, LGSVL).</p>

            <h1>Zappos</h1>
            <p>I worked on experimental AR features to create an interactive online shopping experience during the pandemic for the e-commerce company Zappos (owned by Amazon). I also was a part of the Machine Intelligence team worked on implementing image segmentation models for foot recognition. It was mind boggling watching my work be deployed into the Zappos mobile app beta used by millions of people.</p>
            <p>The internship strucutre was very unique and unstructured and allowed for rapid experimentation!</p>
