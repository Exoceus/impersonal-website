            <h1>Cradle</h1>
            <p>Cradle is an early stage crypto-gaming that I joined as the 8th employee as a <span style={{ textDecoration: "line-through" }}>no stack</span> full stack engineer where it grew from 0 to over 10k users. I have worked 2 co-op terms and part time over the span of 1.5 years at the company.</p>
            <p>Some cool accomplishments were:
                <ul>
                    <li>Designing and developing security architecture using SSS to allow multi-device logins without storing private keys.</li>
                    <li>Worked as the primary developer on a Flask API that serves all company products and was used for a demo for a $4M Series A.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h1>MIT-PITT-RW</h1>
            <p>MIT Driverless is a student club collobration between MIT, Pitsburgh, Rocheter and Waterloo that competes in the Indy Autonomous Challenge (Las Vegas, Indiannapolis, Monza).</p>
            <p>Im a part of Simulation and Infrastructure team that aims to optimize the developer experience of the other subteams (Perception, Controls, etc.) by maintaining and updating the tech stack (Docker, ROS2, Asseto Corsa, LGSVL).</p>

            <h1>Fundamentals First</h1>
            <p>Honestly, I started this blog to force myself to learn technical concepts on a semiregular basis. Since I’m going to read about them on my own time, why not write an article about it? I explore topics I’m curious about while trying to consolidate my learnings into a (mostly) concise and enjoyable introduction to these ideas.</p>
            <p>Also, I am very prone to slacking of on consistently writing for the blog, so if you dont see any articles published in the past few weeks, remind me please.</p>

            <h1>OppHub</h1>
            <p>When I moved to Canada I became vaguely aware of the vast number of extrcurricular activities available for students. However, I found it hard to find extracurriculars related to areas I was interested in.</p>
            <p>Hence, I found myself with a lot of spare time when COVID first hit and I tried to get out of my slump by creating what eveentually became OppHub.The website received 10,000 unique visitors in over 25 different countries with a peak of 600 unique monthly users along with more than 500 unique opportunites.</p>
            <p>OppHub will always hold a very special place in my heart as it was the first webapp I ever made and first exposed to the sheer possibilities of software development, despite innumerable times I wanted to punch my wall in the process of its development.</p>
